# Unity HDRP PSX Effects
A collection of PSX effects optimized for the HD Render Pipeline (HDRP). The aim of this project was to be able to blend the Playstation 1 era graphics and effects with the more cutting-edge techniques included in the HDRP.
This collection of effects include:
- PRB shadergraph for Vertex snapping/Jittering.
- Screen-space pixelation and color adjustment effect.
- Screen-space dithering.
